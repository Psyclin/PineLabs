                      Occupational safety and workers rights among new working
                      age immigrants: The role of settlement organizations
                    </p>

                    <p id="projectDescription">
                      This project aims to build the capacity of immigrant-serving agencies to provide
                      Occupational Health and Safety and Workers’ Rights training to immigrant workers and to
                      strengthen the capacity of new immigrant workers to exercise their rights to safe work
                      practices. In the first activity, a comprehensive review of documents, an online survey, and
                      interviews with key stakeholders were undertaken to assess the landscape of occupational
                      health and safety training and support.
                      The findings indicated a significant gap: existing training programs were not adequately
                      reducing workplace safety risks, and new immigrant workers (NIWs) did not feel capable of
                      asserting their work-related rights. Based on these findings, the second activity engaged nine
                      immigrant workers in participatory action research. Over the course of three months, they
                      discussed their specific challenges and needs and strategized on possible actions.
                      The primary concerns highlighted were insufficient training, lack of awareness about their
                      rights regarding occupational health and safety, reluctance to report safety issues for fear of
                      retaliation, and experiences of psychological threats, such as discrimination. Five educational
                      modules were co-created, addressing the real-life issues these workers faced. These modules
                      cover critical topics such as the importance of OHS, psychological hazards, understanding
                      Canadian workplace culture, effective communication strategies, and essential resources.
                      Tailored to the nuanced needs of NIWs, these modules were then widely shared with
                      immigrant-serving agencies.
                      The final research activity involved eight immigrants in a participatory research effort
                      focused on building their capacity to advocate for their safety rights in the workplace. These
                      participants jointly identified their main concerns—feelings of marginalization, job
                      insecurity, and insufficient resources—and developed collective actions to address these
                      issues. Among the solutions was the creation of a peer support network, a platform for
                      sharing resources, empowering newcomers to promote workplace well-being.
